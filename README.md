# Bot Info

VyprBot is a general-purpose bot with user-based commands, a loyalty system and other interesting and fun commands to check out. I started this bot with 0 knowledge of Node.JS on November 12, 2021. This bot started as a personal project, but eventualy turned into something that I found fun and engaging. I don't see it fizzling out of existence any time soon.

# How can I get the bot in my chat?

If you would like this bot to be added to your chat, make sure to read [the commands page](https://bot.darkvypr.com/commands) before asking. After reading, you can use the "vb suggest command" in the bot's chat. Go to [the bots chat](https://twitch.tv/vyprbot) and use the vb suggest command. Example: "`vb suggest I would like the bot to be added to my chat!`". Once I read the suggestion, you will receive a DM on Twitch from the bot saying if you were accepted or denied. I probably wont deny any bot addition requests, but some suggestions may be.

# Is there a site for this bot?

Yes! The site for VyprBot can be found at: https://bot.darkvypr.com

# How can I remove the bot from my chat?

If you would like this bot to be removed from your chat, use the "vb part" command in your channel's chat.
